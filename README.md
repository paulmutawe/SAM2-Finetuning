# SAM2-Finetuning
Exploration of various hyperparameters to increase the IoU accuracy of Fine-tuning SAM2 on a leaf disease dataset from Kaggle.

Additional evals were explored within a surgical SAM-2 paper that described a novel method called efficent frame pruning in order to reduce similar frames from filling up the memory bank using a cosine similearity score of the frame's embeddings in order to be more computational efficient within a healthcare system perspective.
